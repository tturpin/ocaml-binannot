			OCamlwizard with Binannot

This directory contains an fork of Ocamlwizard, originally written by
David Baudet and Mohamed Iguernelala, which relies on OCaml-Binannot.




- OCamlwizard setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The following assumes that you have root privileges. If not, you will
have to:
- change the install dir with by giving the configure script a
  --prefix option
- manually copy the file emacs/ocamlwizard.el into your ~/.emacs.d/
- append the contents of emacs/52ocamlwizard.el to your ~/.emacs


Compilation and installation
............................


- Compile and install OCaml-Binannot

- In directory ocamlwizard (this directory):

  - ./configure
  - make
  - sudo make install

- Optionnally, in directiory ocamlwizard/test:

  - make


Project configuration
.....................

OCamlwizard uses a very simple configuration file to know about a
projects directories and libraries. When it is invoked on a source
file <file.ml>, it looks for file .ocamlwizard in the directory
containing <file.ml>, or its parent directories, back to the root.
This file must contain exactly one directory name per line, and
compiled interface will be searched in this directories. Relative
directory names are interpreted with respect to the directory
containing the project file .ocamlwizard.




- Using OCamlwizard-Binannot inside emacs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Error recovery:
...............

OCamlwizard is able to ocercome localized errors in the edited file if
the relevant part is correct. This assumes the existence of a previous
version of the file named <file>.ml.last_compiled, which is correct
(the user should copy <file>.ml to <file>.ml.last_compiled after each
successful compilation).

Completion:
...........

Three completion actions are avaiable:

- Path completion (F12): complete a long identifier (value, record
  field, module name), interactively, given a (possibly empty) prefix.
  Empty prefixes are allowed in record (re-)definitions and record
  patterns, such as:
    - let r = {f1 = <expr> ; .	    (at least one field must be given)
    - let r = {<expr> with <maybe some fields> .
    - in a pattern: {f1 = <patt> .


- Pattern expansion (F11): expand a variable or wildcard inside a
  pattern, according to the inferred sub-pattern's type. The variable
  under the cursor is only expanded once, possibly introducing new
  wildcards, and the cursor is positioned on the first created
  wildcard, if any (allowing further expansion by typing F11 again).


- Match cases completion (F3): create a pattern-matching template
  after a match-with construct. This may be invoked just after:
    - match <expr> .
    - match <expr> with .
    - match <expr> with <match cases> .
  The result is very similar to pattern expansion, except that for a
  constructor type (most frequent case), constructors are put on
  successive lines.


Remark: Completion still needs to be improvemed in many respects. See
the test cases for a detailed overview of the current behavior.




- Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Needs to be redefined.


- Internal working overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OCamlwizard executable is called from an editor (for now, emacs)
to process queries such as completion, etc. It parses an types the
buffer up to the editing position, trivially cloing all the opened
syntactical constructs at the cut point. The answer is computed using
information from the resulting typedtree and the formatted result is
passed to the editor which performs minimal further treatment.


Details:
........

- The decision of what to perform (kind of completion, for example) is
  partly made during the parsing (in a rather intricate way).

- Communication with emacs: before calling OCamlwizard, the emacs code
  calls the do-auto-save function to write #file.ml# if needed.
  OCamlwizard checks if an auto-save exists. For positioning the
  cursor at the right place (first wildcard for example), OCamlwizard
  inserts a $ character before it, which is searched backward by
  emacs, then deleted.
